Man, lately I've been feeling like gaming just isn't as enjoyable as it used to be. I'm not achieving any goals while gaming, and I've noticed that it's also affecting my social life. Spending too much time on the computer, downloading games, and only playing them for a short while before moving onâ€”it's becoming a repetitive cycle. I've come to realize that I've invested so much time in video games, and it's leaving me unfulfilled.

I yearn to go outside more often, make real connections, and forge meaningful friendships. It's just not working out for me at the moment. I do have a friend, but it feels like I'm the only one making an effort to maintain the friendship. I wish they would reach out and ask me to hang out too. It's tough feeling like you're the one who cares more in a friendship.

The loneliness is starting to take its toll on me. I feel like I might be experiencing depression or overwhelming sadness. I've lost so many close friends before, and I'm terrified of opening up to new people only to lose them again. I know online platforms like Discord can be great for making friends, but the virtual aspect makes it difficult to truly connect with them since they live far away. It feels almost impossible to build genuine relationships that way.

I'm finding myself with a lot of free time, but I don't know how to fill it in a way that brings me joy and fulfillment. I've tried exploring different hobbies, but none of them seem to resonate with me like gaming did. One of my goals was to learn more about computers, and I've made progress, but now I feel like it's just something everyone can easily achieve, and it doesn't feel as rewarding as I hoped.

Overall, I recognize that my life is lacking balance, and I yearn for a change. I want to find new hobbies and interests that genuinely excite me, and I'm eager to make real connections with people who care about me as much as I care about them. It's time for me to break free from this cycle of gaming and isolation and start living a more fulfilling and well-rounded life.
